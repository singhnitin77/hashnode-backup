## ✨️Inspiration

Gradients are essential to the UI design, whether for your apps, blog's cover images, or content backgrounds. They also make the design stand out. I spend a lot of time hunting for the right gradients out there, So I started thinking of building a web app for the same, with more additional features.

I started by crafting a nice gradient collection of more than 100 gradients. Then moved on to the implementation of other features like gradient generator, tints & shades generator. I'm happy I could come up with the final version of Gradientify.

## 🚀Prototyping, Designing, Development, Deployment
I followed a well-structured process that made it even easier to implement different stages.

###  🛠️Prototyping 
I did some of the research and planning on how to implement different features. Initially, I used pen and paper for a quick wireframe of the gradientify then made the same in the Miro app. I also use Notion for prioritizing content writing and planning for gradientify as it makes it easier to keep track of everything. It seemed pretty straightforward but time-consuming. 

### 🎨Designing
I use Figma for UI/UX design, I had a good eye for design since the beginning so I enjoy every bit of it. I didn’t design all the interfaces at once, as I came up with creative ideas, I took my time and designed the remaining pages.

### 👨‍💻 Development 
I had build designers lobby with React Js, so I continued with React in order to build gradientify, I have used it for many of my side projects apart from Next Js also. 

After designing UI/UX I started with the coding part. Since I have started using Tailwind CSS, building interfaces has been super easy for me, there’s no going back. Started coding each and every component, getting errors in between, debugging, and hunting StackOverflow for help. I keep on pushing myself to complete the project and yeah I enjoyed every bit of it.

For Backend stuff, I did code with my friend, who also helped me in understanding backend development workflow, Backend tech stack includes Node, Mongo, and Express. For email newsletter, nodemailer has been used.

### 💻 Deployment 
Vercel is one of my favorites when it comes to deployment along with Netlify. Both the Front End and Backend of Gradientify are hosted on Vercel.

For custom domains, I have used Namecheap, since I mostly use Namecheap for buying custom domains.

## ✨️ New Features to be added
We’ll be adding more and more amazing features slowly, so you can expect some major updates in the future on gradientify. As of now, these are the next things I have planned to implement.

- Filter gradients by colors.
- Sort gradient by popularity.
- Like a Gradient.
- Authentication.
- 3 Color gradient generator.
- Mesh Gradients.
